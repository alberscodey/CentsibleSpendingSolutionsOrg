                    <p>Our founder and president, Rebecca Rupp, has a passion for budget counseling, and believes <strong>anyone</strong> can achieve their financial goals. Sometimes we just need a little help along the way. And she understands the struggle: Rebecca grew up in a house where every penny counted. As she grew up, Rebecca knew that she loved numbers and wanted to make them work out better not only for her own finances, but for others' as well. She didn't want to achieve financial freedom for just herself; she wanted to pass that freedom on to others, too. Rebecca began taking courses in 1996 to learn different budgeting strategies and wealth building techniques. In 1998, she began sharing what she had learned and experienced. In 2007, Rebecca started her own business counseling folks in financial need. In 2015, she developed the nonprofit, Centsible Spending Solutions (that's us!) to expand her reach for helping others live their dreams. She's a certified Crown Financial Budget Coach with over 20 years of experience under her belt. <a href="#contact">Journey along with us!</a></p>

                </div>
                <div class="testimonial-text">
                    <p>"I have been friends with Rebecca since we were in grade school. At the end of 2011 I was overwhelmed with the reality of years of careless spending habits and abuse of credit card usage in addition to facing divorce after 15+ years of marriage. I didn't know what to do, and was embarrassed by the fact of the damage I had created. I felt I had no options. I didn't want anyone to know the reality of what I was dealing with. I turned to Rebecca to just let me release the secrets I was carrying around. <strong>Without any judgment</strong>, Rebecca immediately said, "Let's work through this together. I know of some ways we can get you back on track." We had several meetings to assess the debts owed, set up a budget and built a plan unique to my needs to knock out the debt. It was tough. It's easy to dig your hole but much harder to climb out. I am proud to say each year I have made great strides in paying down debt with the plan she made and accountability she provided. This year (2018) is going to be the last year of knocking out that debt once and for all- all $35,000 of it! Without her help, I wouldn't have been able to do it. She kept me on track all those years." - LaVon, 43, Topeka, Kansas.</p>
